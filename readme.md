# Face Detection Application Using OpenCV and Keras

In this `Face Detection Application` has detects who you are and tell the `accuracy` in percentage %.

Install Below `Packages` in Your Particular Python Application using `pip install Packages`

| Packages        |
| --------------- |
| Keras           |

| opencv_python   |
| numpy           |


Then you run in your `cmd` using below command
```
python main.py
```

___

Storing Your Face using 2nd Option `Storing Images`
Then you build a model using teachable machine learning model for your collective images.

Link is [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)

Using This `Teachable Machine` That Can be create a model for you and also give a snippet of code that run and analyse to detect the `Accuracy` and `Name` of the person.
